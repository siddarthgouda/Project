# Project
Decentralized Cloud Storage System Using  Blockchain
# Abstraction
This project aims to develop an Decentralized Cloud Storage System
 Using Blockchain As the use of digital data continues to grow, there
 is a greater need for secure and reliable ways to store it. Most cloud
 storage systems today are centralized, meaning all data is stored and
 managed by one main company or server. This can lead to problems
 like data breaches, server failures, and less control for users over their
 own data. To solve these issues, this project introduces a Decentral
ized Cloud Storage System Using Blockchain. In this system, files are
 broken into smaller parts, encrypted for security, Blockchain technol
ogy is used to keep track of file ownership and access, ensuring that
 data is secure, private, and cannot be changed without permission.
 Smart contracts are used to manage access rights automatically. This
 approach removes the need for a central authority and gives users
 more control, better privacy, and stronger protection against data
 loss. This report explains the design, working, and benefits of this
 new storage system.

 # Introduction
 Cloud storage has become an important part of our daily lives. People and orga
nizations use cloud services to store and access their data from anywhere at any
 time. However, most traditional cloud storage systems are centralized, meaning
 all the data is stored and managed by a single company or service provider. This
 can lead to some serious issues, such as data breaches, loss of control over personal
 files, and single points of failure if the central server goes down.
 To overcome these challenges, decentralized storage systems have gained attention. These systems do not rely on a single server. Instead, they use a network
 of computers to store data in a distributed way. This improves security, privacy,
 and reliability.
 In this project, we propose a Decentralized Cloud Storage System Using Blockchain
 technology. Blockchain is known for its secure, transparent, and tamper-proof fea
tures. By using blockchain, we can ensure that data is stored safely, access is
 controlled properly, and files cannot be changed or deleted without permission.
 We also use smart contracts, which are self-executing programs on the blockchain,
 to manage user access and ensure fairness in data handling.
 This introduction gives an overview of why decentralized storage is needed and
 how blockchain can help build a better, safer cloud storage system. The upcoming
 sections of the report will explain the system’s design, how it works, the tools
 used, and its advantages over traditional methods.

 # Problem Statement
 Develop a decentralized cloud storage system using blockchain secure data stor
age solution that eliminates reliance on a single central authority by blockchain
 technology to ensure the security, privacy, and immutability of stored files.
 
 # Objectives
 • Use of Blockchain technology to store memory addresses of encrypted data
 blocks using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) 

 
 • Support multiple file types including PDF,DOCX, images, audio and video
 to storage.
